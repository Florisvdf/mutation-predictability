# mutation-predictability

This repository contains the data and code used to generate results and corresponding 
figures of the recently released preprint 
["What makes the effect of protein mutations difficult to predict?"](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.25.559319).

# System requirements

## Hardware requirements
`predictability` can be run on a standard computer without extensive hardware configurations. 
GPU availability is not necessary, but will greatly speed up the `rita.ipynb` notebook 
executions. 

## Software requirements

### OS requirements
The `predictability` package is supported for macOS and Linux and tested on 
`macOS Ventura 13.5.2`.


### Python requirements
`predictability` requires python &ge; 3.8. All requirements and the corresponding 
versions are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

# Project structure
All experiments and processing of results are organized in notebooks, which can be run by 
installing the `predictability` package. A simple demo can be bound under 
`notebooks/demo.ipynb`. 

# Install instructions
Clone the repository and install with
```
git clone https://github.com/florisvdf/mutation-predictability.git
cd mutation-predictability
pip install .
```
The Potts Regressor model of the `predictability` package makes 
use of [`gremlin_cpp`](https://github.com/sokrypton/GREMLIN_CPP). 
To use the Potts Regressor, make sure that `gremlin_cpp` is installed 
and is added to `$PATH`. 

Installation on a typical computer should take no longer than 10 minutes.

# Reproducibility
Results can be reproduced by simply executing all notebooks under the `notebooks` 
directory. Plots can be generated by executing the `notebooks/figures_for_publication` 
notebook. Different sample assignment to train and test folds can be achieved by 
executing the notebooks while changing the variable `seed` in the second cell.
